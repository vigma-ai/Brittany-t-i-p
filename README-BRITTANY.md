## ✍️ Daily Use

### End of Your Shift:

   ```
   Brittany
   Date: 1/29
   Amount: 131
   ```

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### For Clear Photos:
- ✅ Good lighting (not too dark)
- ✅ Hold phone steady
- ✅ Make sure numbers are visible
- ✅ Write clearly (doesn't have to be perfect)

### The App Reads:
- **Dates:** 1/29, 01/29, 1-29 (all work)
- **Amounts:** 131, $131, 131.00 (all work)

### If OCR Misses Something:
- You can edit the amount before it saves
- Or just manually type it in (still faster than paper logs!)

## 📊 Track Your Money

Tap the **"Stats"** tab to see:

### Export for Taxes:

2. Scroll to bottom

## 🔒 Your Privacy

## 🆘 Troubleshooting
